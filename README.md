# Pre-Work Study Guide Website

## Description

I was motivated to create this study guide as a companion, easy reference site that I could use whilst I am learning about front-end web development. This site includes key notes on these new technologies that I am learning about and will serve to help keep me on track when I create new websites. The colours match my VScode theme which I find relatable and inspiring. During this project I learnt and practiced a git flow that would be suitable for collaboritive projects. I also learnt a bit about javascript and how it connects to a html file. I was also introduced to the console functionality. 



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are 5 main topics that I have taken notes on during the start of my education. They are Terminal Commands, Git & Github, HTML, CSS & Javascript. Each section contains easy reference material associated with each topic such as code snippets and tips. 

If you open the developer console, the topics will be listed along with a randomly generated topic idea, as a suggestion for study. 


## Credits

- Part of the creation of this website involved lessons given by EDx Front-end web development bootcamp. 

- The colours were chosen from my favorite VScode theme called "Pink Cat Boo"
